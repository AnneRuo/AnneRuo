### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anne Ruohonen and I am a System & Implementation Specialist and a NetSuite developer in the beginning of my new career. 
Three years ago on a whim I enrolled in a Python course and I was completely hooked after my first â€˜Hello, Worldâ€™.

#### :seedling: What have I learnt during these years?
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] Bootstrap
- [x] JavaScript
- [x] Java
- [x] jQuery
- [x] React
- [x] PHP
- [x] Python
- [x] MySQL/MariaDB
- [x] some AI, RPA and Machine Learning stuff
- [x] Iâ€™m not gonna be a game developer

#### :star2: This is what I am focusing on now:
- [ ] improve my JavaScript and SuiteScript skills
- [ ] finish my information technology studies at HAMK

#### What would I like to do in the future?
ðŸš€ To become a JavaScript master and develop into a better NetSuite developer.
