### Hi there 👋

My name is Anne Ruohonen and I am an application consultant, payroll and HR system key user and a helpdesk person. 

I am also passionate about learning new things. Two years ago on a whim I enrolled in a Python course and I was completely hooked after my first ‘Hello, World’.

##### Fun fact:
🐴 I also signed up for a horseback riding course a year ago on a whim. It is also super nice and I couldn’t stop riding after the course either but I’m not going to become a professional rider.
